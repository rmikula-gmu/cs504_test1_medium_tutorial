"[1] Section 9601(a) of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2, 135 Stat. 4 (March 11, 2021), added section 6428B to 
the Internal Revenue Code (Code).  Section 6428B provides an eligible individual for their first taxable year beginning in 2021 a 
refundable tax credit of up to $1,400 ($2,800 for eligible individuals filing a joint tax return), plus $1,400 per qualifying dependent 
of the eligible individual(s). This tax credit is referred to in section 6428B as a “2021 recovery rebate to individuals.” 
Section 6428B(g)(3) instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to make advance refunds of this credit “as rapidly as possible” and by 
December 31, 2021. (In other words, no advance refund may be disbursed after that date.) The IRS refers to the advance refund of this 
credit as a “Third Round EIP.”

The 2021 credit is reduced proportionally as a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds a threshold and rises to a full phase-out 
amount. The threshold and full phase-out amounts are $150,000 and $160,000 in the case of a joint return or qualifying widow or widower, 
$112,500 and $120,000 in the case of a head of household, and $75,000 and $80,000 otherwise. Those ineligible for the credit are 
(1) nonresident alien individuals, (2) individuals who can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, and (3) an estate or trust. 
When spouses file jointly, each spouse must have a valid social security number (SSN) to receive the individual portion of the credit for 
that spouse (in other words, for the married couple to receive the full $2,800), unless either spouse is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces 
at any time during the taxable year. In that case, only one spouse needs to have a valid SSN. An individual without a valid SSN can still 
receive up to $1,400 for a qualified dependent claimed on the individual’s return if the individual meets all other eligibility and income 
requirements.

An individual’s eligibility for and amount of the Third Round EIP was based on the individual’s Tax Year 2020 return. If that return was not 
filed as of the initial determination date for the individual’s Third Round EIP, the IRS used the individual’s Tax Year 2019 return to make an 
“initial” Third Round EIP. If an individual filed a Tax Year 2020 return after the initial determination date for the individual’s Third Round 
EIP and before the additional determination date, and that Tax Year 2020 return indicated that the individual was eligible for a larger 
credit amount, the IRS disbursed a “plus-up” payment to the individual. This additional amount was equal to the total amount of Third 
Round EIP to which the individual was entitled, minus the initial amount that the IRS disbursed to that individual. The amounts shown in 
the table include both initial and plus-up payments issued by the time the data were tabulated.  

Eligible individuals who did not file a Tax Year 2019 or 2020 return but received Social Security retirement, survivor or disability 
benefits (SSDI), Railroad Retirement benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Veterans Affairs benefits automatically received a 
Third Round EIP. The IRS also used information provided by individuals who filed in 2020 a Tax Year 2019 return through the 
“Non-filers: Enter Your Information Here” online portal, or through other special or simplified filing procedures published by the Treasury 
Department and the IRS in 2020. The Treasury Department and the IRS provided these 2020 filing options to help eligible individuals 
who did not have a tax filing obligation to receive a First Round EIP provided under section 6428 of the Code, as added by 
section 2201(a) of the CARES Act, Public Law 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (March 27, 2020).

On June 14, 2021, the Treasury Department and the IRS released a new “Non-filer Sign-up Tool” on IRS.gov to help eligible individuals 
who had not filed a Tax Year 2020 or 2019 return to file a Tax Year 2020 return and receive, among other tax benefits, Third Round EIPs. 
This tool is an update of last year's IRS Non-filers tool. Similarly, the Treasury Department and the IRS published in 2021 for individuals 
who do not have a tax filing obligation simplified filing procedures that were based on the simplified filing procedures published in 2020 
for the First Round EIP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[2] Includes payments made by the IRS to individuals with an address in Puerto Rico but does not include payments 
made by the Puerto Rico Treasury Department.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[3] State comes from the Tax Year 2019 or 2020 return used to determine an individual’s eligibility for and amount of the Third Round EIP. 
For individuals disbursed a plus-up payment, the total of the initial and plus-up payments is associated with the State from the 
Tax Year 2020 return used to determine the plus-up payment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES:  Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
                 Table does not double-count payments that were issued, reversed, and reissued. (A reissuance could occur, for example, 
                 if a bank account that was targeted for an electronic funds transfer was closed at the time the Third Round EIP was issued.)
                 Table does not count reversed payments.  (A reversal could occur, for example, if a paper check was returned to the IRS
                 as undeliverable mail).
                 Data are through 2021 Cycle 22 (June 3, 2021).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
