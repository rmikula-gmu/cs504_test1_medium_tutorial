"[1] Section 2201(a) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Public Law 116-136, 134 
Stat. 281 (March 27, 2020) added section 6428 to the Internal Revenue Code (Code).  Section 6428(a) provides an eligible 
individual for their first taxable year beginning in 2020 a refundable tax credit of up to $1,200 ($2,400 for eligible 
individuals filing a joint tax return), plus $500 per qualifying child of the eligible individual.  This tax credit is 
referred to in section 6428 as a “2020 recovery rebate for individuals.”  Section 6428(f)(3)(A) instructs the 
Secretary of the Treasury to make advance refunds of this credit “as rapidly as possible” and before January 1, 2021.  
The IRS refers to the advance refund of this credit as an economic impact payment Economic Impact Payment (EIP). 
EIPs made under section 6428 are referred to as a ""First Round EIP."" 

The credit phases out at a rate of 5% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (AGI) in excess of a threshold.  The 
threshold is $150,000 in the case of a joint return, $112,500 in the case of a head of household, and $75,000 otherwise.  
Those ineligible for the credit are (1) nonresident alien individuals, (2) individuals who can be claimed as a 
dependent by another taxpayer, and (3) an estate or trust.  When spouses file jointly, both spouses must have a valid 
social security number (SSN) to receive the credit, unless either spouse is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces at any 
time during the taxable year.  In that case, only one spouse needs to have a valid SSN. 

Eligibility for, and the amount of, a First Round EIP was based on an individual’s Tax Year 2019 return, or if a Tax Year 2019 
return was not filed, the individual’s Tax Year 2018 return.  Eligible individuals who otherwise did not have a tax filing 
obligation but received Social Security benefits, Railroad Retirement benefits, compensation and pension benefit 
payments from the Veterans Administration, or Supplemental Security Income received a First Round EIP without having to 
file a return.  Other eligible individuals who otherwise did not have a tax filing obligation needed to submit 
information through the “Non-filers: Enter Your Information Here” online portal, or through other special or simplified 
procedures provided by the IRS, to receive a First Round EIP.  Eligible individuals who did not receive some or all of the
recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled as a First Round EIP may claim the remaining amount of the recovery rebate
credit when filing their 2020 tax returns.

The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted as Division M of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021, Public Law 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182 (December 27, 2020) added section 6428A to the Code.
This legislation created an ""additional 2020 recovery rebate for individuals.""  The IRS refers to the advance refund of this
credit as a ""Second Round EIP.""  This legislation also altered for the ""2020 recovery rebate credit"" the requirements
regarding the inclusion of valid SSN and changed the phase-out threshold for qualifying widows and widowers to be 
$150,000.  These statutory changes did not affect the First Round EIPs, as reported in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[2] Includes residents of U.S. territories, U.S. citizens abroad, and returns filed from Army Post Office and Fleet Post
Office addresses by members of the armed forces stationed overseas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTES:  Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.
                 The numbers shown reflect First Round EIPs successfully issued to eligible recipients based on taxpayer account
                 information whereas reports released for August and earlier periods did not account for reversed or undeliverable
                 First Round EIPs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
